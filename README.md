Simple-C-Raymarcher
===================

A simple Ray Marcher written in C, without any additional libraries that calculates a 3d scene and writes it to image file.
Started as a way to refresh my memory on C (I'm developing mostly in Java), but maybe someone will find it usefull or interesting :)

Compiles fine with GCC.
